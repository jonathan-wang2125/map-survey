# Instructions
We will be evaluating how different AIs interact with maps. You will be given a map and a question to answer about it. The questions concern such topics as physical features in the map, information from pre-existing map knowledge like latitude lines, and information from charts.

## AIMS

<span style="color: red;">**Your responsibility is to answer the question using the map.** </span>Some but not all of these questions were generated using AI models. Because of this, some questions might be bad; they might be vague or ambiguous, unanswerable or too difficult. We have provided examples in the Appendix.

## Your Responsbility

1)<ins>**Answer the question as best as you can.**</ins> 
Answers should be provided regardless of whether it’s a good question or not. <span style="color: red;">**Please feel free to use Google and/or Google/Apple Maps to locate landmarks, understand terms, or to help orient yourself on the map.**</span> Please note that if the image appears unclear, going into full screen will open a higher-resolution version.

A good answer SHOULD…
 * Be factual and clear 
 * Should rely on the map, not pre-existing knowledge of geography (although it may rely on existing knowledge of map conventions).

A good answer should NOT…
* Be debatable or subjective
* Be vague/unclear what the answer is to the question

2)<ins>**Determine if it’s a good or bad question**</ins>

A good question SHOULD…
* Be answerable with just the map, and an ordinary person’s knowledge of how to interpret maps
* Have a single clear answer - if there are multiple correct answers, it’s not a good question.

A good question should NOT…
* be a count value that is greater than 10.
* be very difficult. It may take a while to find the map items referred to in the question, but once you do, answering it should be simple.

<span style="color: red;">**If it’s a bad question, please STILL make your best attempt to answer the question.**</span> We have provided a box you can check which will reveal a field where you can input your explanation for why it’s a poor question. Please fill out this part <span style="color: red;">**ONLY**</span> if you think it’s a bad question.

## Appendix: Examples of Bad Questions

![image info](./jeffbusby_site.png)

**Bad Question (Too Vague/Ambiguous):** What color is the bathroom sign?<br>
Explanation: There are two signs signifying bathrooms and both have different colors: blue and black. 

**Bad Question (Unanswerable with Map):** Where is Chicago relative to the Exhibit?<br>
Explanation: Chicago is neither directly on the map nor referenced on the map and thus impossible to answer without additional information

**Bad Question (Too Difficult):** How many dashes are used to label the Little Mountain Trail?<br>
Explanation: Requires highly precise counting. A good rule of thumb is that anything with a count higher than 8 is ‘unfair’.
